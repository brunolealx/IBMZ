Based on the Open Mainframe Project COBOL Programming course https://www.openmainframeproject.org/all-projects/cobolprogrammingcourse, the challenges are to guide you through the content with access to the community-maintained libraries and instructions available here.

Here are the zOS userid and password you will need for your labs/exercises - take note! If you need to find them again, use the zOS Password Reset button on the homepage

Watch out for any host addresses - make sure to set VSCode and TSO addresses to 204.90.115.200, instead of 192.86.32.250.

The COBOL course environment was previously hosted in a different IBM z/OS virtual machine - there may still be references in some documentation (usually in images/screenshots) that refer to the IP Address of that system (192.86.32.250) -- whenever required, replace this address with the IBM Z XPlore system address (204.90.115.200)



If you have joined through the IBM Learning platform (video course), or Coursera, you should use the course structure and materials provided on that platform to work through the course, but you can use the COBOL Courses forum on the IBM Z Xplore homepage.
